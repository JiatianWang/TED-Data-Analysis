# This suggests a very high average high level of popularity of TED talks.

# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# Although the TED website give us access to all the comments posted publicly, this dataset

# =============================================================================
# # observations:
# 1, On average, there are 191.56 commentss on every TED talks. Assuming the comments are constructive criticism,
# we can conclude that the TED Online Community is highly involved in disscussions revoling TED talks 
# 2, There is a huge std associated with the comments. In fact, it is even larger than the mean suggesting that 
# the measures may be sentive to outliers. We shall plot his to check the nature of the distribution 
# 3ï¼Œ The minimum number of comments on a talk is 2 and the maximum is 6404. The range is 6402. The minimum number,
# though, may be as a result of the talk being posted extremely recently
# =============================================================================

# # This clearly suggests that the mean obtained above has been heavily influenced by outliers. 
# # This is possible because the number of sample is only 2550 talks.
# # Another question that I am interested in is if the number of views is correlated with the number of comments.
# # we should think that this is the case as more popularvideo tend to have more comments.
# =============================================================================

# To find out whether popular video have more comments 

# Draw a scatter plot with marginal histograms:

# sns.jointplot(x = 'views', y = 'comments', data = df, kind = 'hex')

df[['views','comments']].corr()

# =============================================================================
# As the scatterplot and the correlatoin matrix show, the pearson coefficient is slightly more than 0.5.

# which talk tend to attract the largest amount of discussion ?

# To ansewer this question, we will define a new feature discussion quotient which is simply the ratio of the
