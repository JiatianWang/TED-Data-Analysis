# 1,Ken Robinson's talk on Do schools kill creativity? is the most popular TED talk of all time with 47.2 million views
# 2,Also coincidentally, it is also one of the first talks to ever be uploaded on the TED site
# 3,Robinson's talk is closely followed by Amy Cuddy's talk on Your body language may shape who you are

# =============================================================================
# The average number of views on TED Talk in 1.6 millon, and the meadian number of views is 1.12,
# whcih is the positve skewed
# This suggests a very high average high level of popularity of TED talks. 
# we also notice that the majority of talks have 
# views less than 4 million. we will condider this as the cutoff point when constructing box plots in teh later sections.
# =============================================================================

#  Commnets
# =============================================================================
# Although the TED website give us access to all the comments posted publicly, this dataset 
# only gives us teh number of comments. we will therefore have to restrict our analysis to this feature only.
# you could try performing textual analysis by scraping the website for commments.
# =============================================================================


df['comments'].describe()

# =============================================================================
# # observations:
# 1, On average, there are 191.56 commentss on every TED talks. Assuming the comments are constructive criticism,
# we can conclude that the TED Online Community is highly involved in disscussions revoling TED talks 
# 2, There is a huge std associated with the comments. In fact, it is even larger than the mean suggesting that 
# the measures may be sentive to outliers. We shall plot his to check the nature of the distribution 
# 3ï¼Œ The minimum number of comments on a talk is 2 and the maximum is 6404. The range is 6402. The minimum number,
# though, may be as a result of the talk being posted extremely recently
# =============================================================================

sns.distplot(df['comments'])
sns.distplot(df[df['comments'] < 500]['comments'])

# =============================================================================
# # From the plot above, we can see that the bulk of the talks have fewer than 500 comments.
# # This clearly suggests that the mean obtained above has been heavily influenced by outliers. 
# # This is possible because the number of sample is only 2550 talks.
# # Another question that I am interested in is if the number of views is correlated with the number of comments.
# # we should think that this is the case as more popularvideo tend to have more comments.
# =============================================================================

# To find out whether popular video have more comments 

# Draw a scatter plot with marginal histograms:

j = sns.jointplot(x = 'views', y = 'comments', data = df, kind = 'reg')
j.annotate(stats.pearsonr)
# sns.jointplot(x = 'views', y = 'comments', data = df, kind = 'kde', color = 'g')
# sns.jointplot(x = 'views', y = 'comments', data = df).plot_joint(sns.kdeplot, zorder = 0, n_levels = 6)
# sns.jointplot(x = 'views', y = 'comments', data = df, kind = 'hex')

df[['views','comments']].corr()

# =============================================================================
# As the scatterplot and the correlatoin matrix show, the person coefficient is slightly more than 0.5.
# This suggest a medium to strong correlation between the two quantities. This was pretty expected as mentioned above
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# As can be seen above, Richard Dawkins' talk on Militant atheism generated the greateest amount of discussion 
# and opinions despite having significantly lesser views than Ken Robinosns' talk, which is second in the list.
# This raises some interesting questions
# 
# which talk tend to attract the largest amount of discussion ?
# 
# To ansewer this question, we will define a new feature discussion quotient which is simply the ratio of the 
# number of comments to the number of views. we will them check which talks have the largest dicussion quotient
# =============================================================================

# quesitons? i think it only 3 or 4 would be categoried to faith and religion
# 
# This analysis has acutally raised extremely intersting insight. Half of the talks in the top 10 are on the lines of 
# Faith and Religion. I suspect science and religion is still a very hotly debaed topic in 21st century. We shall
# come back to this hypothesis in a later section 
# 
# 
# The most discusses talk, thoughm is The case for same sex marriage(which has religious undertones). this is not 
# that surprising considering the amount of debate the topic caused back in 2009
